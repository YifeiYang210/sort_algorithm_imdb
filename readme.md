## Introduction

This project guides you through the implementation of various algorithms using a real-world movie dataset, enhancing your understanding of data management.

Create a small program that sorts movies according to the rating of your choice and learn the basics of time complexity analysis and various searching and sorting algorithms. You will practice concepts frequently tested in technical interviews at top tech companies.


## What you'll learn

Once you choose a project, we'll provide you with a study plan that includes all the necessary topics from your course to get it built. Here’s what awaits you:
1. Store the data. Create a dataset based on the IMDB movies collection in an appropriate Python collection.
2. Linear Search. Implement a linear search algorithm on the resulting set and print the movie titles with a rating of 6.
3. Low to High. Our data is not sorted yet. Let's do it based on ratings and the bubble sort algorithm.
4. Need for Speed. Now, when the data is sorted, decrease the searching time with the binary search algorithm and print the movie titles with a rating of 6.
5. Combine the Algorithms. Learn about another sorting algorithm — merge sort. Combine it with the binary search algorithm and compare the time complexity.

Other features will be coming soon!
